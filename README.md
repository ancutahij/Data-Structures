# Data-Structures
The following repository contains implementations for a dynamic vector, a stack with integer elements, a generic stack, a generic queue, 
a heap, a hash table and an AVL tree.
The aim of this project is focusing on more advanced data structures (e.g. hash table, heap, etc) and familiarizing in working with pointers
(dereferencing pointers, function pointers,  deallocating correctly the memory, etc).
